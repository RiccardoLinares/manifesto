Hello World!

I'm Riccardo Linares 👋
=======================

Tech Founder
------------

I love working on indie projects with high potential for impact.

Something about me:

*   I was born on a rainy Saturday in July 1994, not exactly a typical summer evening.
*   From an early age I studied different programming languages because I wanted to be a badass hacker.
*   In 2011 I co-founded my first company that allowed people to personalize Facebook. +4M users. Great experience! 🚀
*   Around the age of 18, I realized I wanted to build my professional career on digital and innovation.
*   I wrote about technology and innovation for Tweaknology. Through this experience I met my future partners!
*   Since 2015 I managed for two years the communication of IngDan Italia, an Italian spin-off of the multinational Cogobuy focused on IoT 🤖.
*   Since February 2017 I have been working with Campus Party. Goals achieved:

*   ✔️ #CPIT1 (2017)
*   ✔️ #CPIT2 (2018)
*   ✔️ #CPIT3 (2019)
*   ✔️ #CP Digital Edition (2020-21)

*   Together with my partners, in 2017, I started studying Blockchain technology and investing in Cryptocurrencies. A few months later, also thanks to a Business Angel, DoubleBit was born. #Training #Mining #Blockchain ⛏️
*   In 2019 I founded IDK.business with the goal of developing bootstrapping services, raising capital and bringing value to companies.
*   Today, I work on digital processes and developing innovative products that can create a positive impact on thousands of people.
*   I am often told that I dream too big, each time I reply that it is never enough!
*   I love extreme sports: 🧗🏄✈️(🏓)
*   3 books I recommend reading:
    *   E-Myth (Michael E. Gerber)
    *   Shoe Dog (Phil Knight)
    *   Zero to One (Peter Thiel)
